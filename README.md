# Pesterchum Beta (2/4)

### This is my copy/version of the messaging client from Homestuck.

It is an Electron Client connecting to a Private Python Server using Websockets

Current Main Features:
 - User Registration
 - User Login
 - Friendships

Currently friendships are stored on the database and fully work on the backend however the client currently cannot process friendships.
However I wanted to post something nontheless as an update.

If you plan to build it yourself from source please use Electron Forge or Electron Builder, however there will be a doc for this later on.

**Note:** The current version of Pesterchum has no certificates for SSL and all passwords are plaintext.
This is only for testing purposes and will exist during the final release (4/4 stage).

Thank you for your cooperation.
