# Pesterchum 0.5

### This is my copy/version of the messaging client from Homestuck.

It is a Electron Client connecting to a private server.

Currently has Registration and Login of User with Chumhandle (email and password)

Soon to Follow is Friendships and Chatting then there will be a fully fledged release to start version 1.0

If you plan to build it yourself from source please use Electron Forge or Electron Builder however there will be a doc for this later on.

**Note:** The current version of Pesterchum has __NO__ SSL/TLS so all connections to the server or other clients are ***PLAINTEXT***.
This is __ONLY__ for the beta version. The fully fledged version **will** have encryption however for testing purposes it is all open!!!
Passwords are also currently **NOT HASHED** this means to please not use any real passwords for the beta version as they are all open to the world to see.

Thank you for your cooperation.

### Planned Ideas:
 - Memos
 - Mood / Status
 - Password Hashing
 - Fully Fledged Settings -> includes custom timetables, color, username change, etc.
 - Quirks Page with dynamic regex to make your own custom quirks
 - Password Reset
 - Username Change
 - Pesterchum Skins / Themes: without hardcoded colors (help would be nice :D)
 - Emojis -> [skull]
 - More to always come! these are just required before I have a "canon" functioning release
